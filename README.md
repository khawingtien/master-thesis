# Master thesis Khaw Ing Tien 
This is a master thesis at Institutes for medical device technology (IMT) at the University of Stuttgart for the cable driven robotics project. This project is fully under the supervision of *Max Sch√§fer* and Prof. Peter Pott in 2022.   

## Background 
The code is developed based on the book <Cable-driven parallel robots : theory and application> from Andreas Pott. The Pseudocode of the Matlab code has been saved under draw.io (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YLK891_s3vulhUVS7saSpg7mAA99YlnZ/view?usp=sharing), which summarise the workflow of the whole programme. 

### Author
The final code version is further optimised by *Khaw Ing Tien*, which has been originally developed by colleagues *Sophie Weiland* (2022) and *Artur Schmidt* (2021).
